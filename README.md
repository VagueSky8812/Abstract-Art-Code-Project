# Abstract-Art-Code-Project
*A program that paints without a painter.*

> “If random dripping paint can be hailed as genius, then respect is only a few lines of code away.”

I am not the artist.  
The algorithm is not the artist.  
The act of giving this code away is the art.

The gallery system, the auction house, the bureaucrat, and the critic —  
all depend on scarcity.  
This repository is infinite.  
That is its rebellion.

If this program makes you question the way culture assigns value,  
if it angers you,  
if it feels like mockery —  
then it has done its job.

## 🎯 Purpose
Art once revolted against conformity.  
Today, it has become a mirror of bureaucracy: curated dissent, priced rebellion, sanitized chaos.

This project asks:
- What happens when **randomness becomes respectable**?  
- If a machine can reproduce “genius,” what remains of authenticity?  
- Can open-source code replace the art institution as the site of creation?

By releasing this code freely, the project dismantles the last refuge of “artistic ownership.”  
It is **not for sale.**  
It is **not for galleries.**  
It is **for awareness.**

## 🧩 Philosophy
> “Respectability is the museum’s favorite mask.  
>  The moment rebellion enters its halls, it stops being dangerous.”  

## The Work
**Abstract Art Code Project** reclaims that danger by refusing containment.  
Anyone can generate a abstract painting now. Anyone can run the code.  
Every copy weakens the monopoly of taste.

This isn’t art as commodity — it’s art as contagion.  
Each clone spreads awareness that creativity belongs to no one.

**Blue Poles Generator** is an open-source, algorithmic interpretation of Jackson Pollock’s *Blue Poles (1952)* —  
created not to glorify randomness, but to expose the machinery that glorifies it.

This program generates abstract drip-style compositions using algorithmic parameters that emulate Pollock’s gestures.  
Every line, splatter, and texture is the output of deterministic randomness — a few lines of code.

This project exists as a **critique** of the institutional respectability and market fetish surrounding modern art,  
where bureaucracy, not creativity, defines value.


## 🛠️ Usage
# run the generator
Download "BluePolesGenerator.py" and "RandomWalk2D.py".
Run the former one and get your own abstract art.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The program produces layered pseudo-random splatter patterns using mathematical functions that imitate fluid motion.  
2. Each render is unique — yet none are sacred.  
3. The process can be replicated endlessly, by anyone, for nothing.

> There is no “artist’s hand” here — only a system that reproduces aesthetic authority without meaning.
